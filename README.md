# Project-TBS
This is a pilot project of Treasury Board Secretariat - Ontario. Currently I am working on this project as a volunteer. 
Objective: Improving AI text summarization efficiency by focusing on Key labor relation terms and training the model with LR specific dataset.

Some of my tasks are:

• Research on labor relation specific datasets for training Summarization model
• Build the training dataset if required
• Modify the existing summarization model or build a new abstractive model
• Evaluate the performance of the model
• Assist the team from TBS to review the efficiency and establish the final model.
